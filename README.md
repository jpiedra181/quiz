# 🎮 Quiz Game

Welcome to **Quiz Game**, a simple but fun trivial app where you can test your knowledge on different topics like **History**, **Literature**, **Geography**, **Mathematics**, and **Science**.

The game consists of **10 questions per topic**, and you'll get your score at the end.

> This project was also a personal challenge: I wanted to learn how to build and deploy a **multi-page site** using Vite — and after a lot of trial and error, I did it! 💪

## ✨ Final Thoughts
Publishing a project with multiple pages using Vite and deploying it to GitHub Pages was a real challenge for me. I faced lots of small issues — from routing and file structure to Tailwind configuration and asset loading — but I kept pushing until I made it work.

This was a huge personal win, and I hope this project helps others who are starting out just like I did.
